    "description": "There's a great deal of wisdom in a crowd, but how do you listen to a thousand people talking at once  Identifying the wants, needs, and knowledge of internet users can be like listening to a mob.    In the Web 2.0 era, leveraging the collective power of user contributions, interactions, and feedback is the key to market dominance. A new category of powerful programming techniques lets you discover the patterns, inter-relationships, and individual profiles   the collective intelligence   locked in the data people leave behind as they surf websites, post blogs, and interact with other users.    Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective-intelligence concepts using Java. It is the first Java-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technical implementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches.    This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.    Along the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard.",

    "description": "In complex software projects, managing the development process can be as critical to success as writing the code itself. A project may involve dozens of developers, managers, architects, testers, and customers, hundreds of builds, and thousands of opportunities to get off-track. To keep tabs on the people, tasks, and components of a medium- to large-scale project, most teams use a development system that allows for easy monitoring, follow-up, and accountability.    Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2008 (TFS), the server component of Microsoft's Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), provides a powerful collaborative platform for software-development teams. The product offers an integrated toolset for tracking work items, creating test cases, managing source code, generating builds, constructing database schemas, and so on. Because in software development one size does not fit all, TFS provides process customization, project management, and reporting capabilities to build solutions around your requirements.    Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a hands-on guide to Team Foundation Server 2008. Written for developers with a good handle on TFS basics, this book shows you how to solve real-life problems. It's not a repetition of Microsoft's product documentation. Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a practitioner's handbook for how to work with TFS under common constraints. This book walks you through real-life software engineering problems based on hundreds of hours of TFS experience.    You'll benefit from expert author Jamil Azher's extensive interactions with members of Microsoft's TFS team and MVPs, survey feedback from the author's blog, and interviews with organizations and user groups using TFS. Instead of just offering a high-level overview, the book provides detailed solutions for solving common   and not-so-common   problems using TFS. It discusses the strengths as well as weaknesses of TFS, and suggests appropriate problem resolution steps, workarounds, or custom solutions.",

The book opens with a discussion of distributed computing in general, as well as its design principles and technologies. Then Distributed PowerBuilder is examined in detail. By building a simple application step by step, the author discusses all of the concepts and components needed for building a PowerBuilder application and shows how to make the application available over a network.    Finally, the author explores how PowerBuilder can be used in distributed solutions both with and without using DPB.    Distributed Application Development with PowerBuilder 6.0 is for any PowerBuilder developer looking for information on distributed computing options with the PowerBuilder environment. IS managers, system architects, and developers using many different technologies can learn how PowerBuilder can be used as all or part of the solution for building distributed applications.    The main topic of this book is Distributed PowerBuilder (DPB). It covers the basics of building a DPB application and walks through each new feature with examples including the Shared object, DataWindow synchronization, Server Push and Web.PB. It also explains distributed computing technologies and design principles so that your application can be built to handle the stresses of a distributed environment.  "

    "description": "3D User Interfaces with Java 3D is a practical guide for providing next-generation applications with 3D user interfaces for manipulation of in-scene objects. Emphasis is on standalone and web-based business applications, such as for online sales and mass customization, but much of what this book offers has broad applicability to 3D user interfaces in other pursuits such as scientific visualization and gaming.  This book provides an extensive conceptual framework for 3D user interface techniques, and an in-depth introduction to user interface support in the Java 3D API, including such topics as picking, collision, and drag-and-drop. Many of the techniques are demonstrated in a Java 3D software framework included with the book, which also provides developers with many general-purpose building blocks for constructing their own user interfaces.    Applications and their use of 3D are approached realistically. The book is geared towards sophisticated user interfaces for the \"everyday user\" who doesn't have a lot of time to learn another application--much less a complicated one--and an everyday computer system without exotic devices like head mounted displays and data gloves. Perhaps the best description of this book is: \"A roadmap from Java 3D to 'Swing 3D'.\"",

    "description": "JSTL is an important simplification of the Java web platform. With JSTL, page authors can now write dynamic pages using standard HTML-like tags and an easy-to-learn expression language. JSTL is a standard from the Java Community Process, and its expression language will become part of JSP 2.0.    JSTL in Action shows you how to write rich, dynamic web pages without programming. From simple loops to tricky XML processing, every feature of JSTL is covered and exercised in numerous useful examples. Whether you are a novice page author or an experienced Java programmer, this book shows you easy ways to create powerful web sites.    To help readers who don't already have a JSP container run the examples in the book, there's a free companion download here. This bundle contains a ready-to-run JSP container, a JSTL implementation, and all the book's examples.",

The more difficult objects and services are given special attention; these are the ones that are sure to enhance your image as an expert in this emerging technology. The text is written with the same easy-to-understand prose that has marked the PowerBuilder Dojo as one of the premier PowerBuilder sites worldwide.    At first, the programmer will find this book a comprehensive guide to the wide scope of these libraries. Later it will serve as a handy memory tool for finding exactly what is needed at implementation time.    The manager will find this book an invaluable source for understanding which tools are available for immediate implementation.

As a SQL Server administrator, you must be equipped to handle myriad day-to-day tasks to keep your database healthy, and you must also be prepared to act quickly when something unexpected happens.    SQL Server 2008 Administration in Action offers over 100 DBA-tested, high-value, best practices that will help you tame the beast and keep it under control. Unlike the many comprehensive SQL Server reference tomes out there that attempt to cover the whole SQL Server feature set, this book drills down on the techniques, procedures, and practices that help you keep your database running like clockwork.    SQL Server 2008 Administration in Action focuses the production DBA, digging deep into the various tasks specific to that role. Expert author Rod Colledge--check him out at sqlCrunch.com--teaches you best practices that cover the lifecycle of a SQL Server system, including infrastructure design, installation, and operational maintenance. And while many of these techniques will work in any recent version of SQL Server, you'll find full coverage of emerging SQL Server 2008 best practices.    Each technique is presented in a task-driven style, and in the order of the typical life cycle of a SQL Server system. This allows you to easily open the book at the appropriate page and focus on what you need to know for each specific situation.",

The book moves from the very simplest applications through advanced applications such as generic programming, multiple dispatch, and object-oriented persistence. Thus, it offers a much-needed resource for persons new to Perl, as well as new and valuable insights and techniques for even the most accomplished Perl programmers.    Beyond explaining the syntax and semantics of Perl's inbuilt object-oriented features, Object Oriented Perl explains how to apply those features in a wide range of programming techniques. Each technique is illustrated with complete examples.    Object Oriented Perl also discusses the latest relevant Perl modules, which are freely available and can greatly simplify object-oriented development in Perl. In particular, it examines the new standard \"fields\" module and the associated pseudo-hash construct.    No other book covers the topic of object-oriented software development in Perl in such breadth, to such depth, or in such a readable manner. Complete source code for Object Oriented Perl is available online to owners of the book.",

They get frustrated losing their scroll position; they get annoyed waiting for refresh; they struggle to reorient themselves on every new page. And the list goes on. With asynchronous JavaScript and XML, known as \"Ajax,\" you can give them a better experience. Once users have experienced an Ajax interface, they hate to go back. Ajax is new way of thinking that can result in a flowing and intuitive interaction with the user.\n<br>\n<i>Ajax in Action</i> helps you implement that thinking--it explains how to distribute the application between the client and the server (hint: use a \"nested MVC\" design) while retaining the integrity of the system. You will learn how to ensure your app is flexible and maintainable, and how good, structured design can help avoid problems like browser incompatibilities. Along the way it helps you unlearn many old coding habits. Above all, it opens your mind to the many advantages gained by placing much of the processing in the browser. If you are a web developer who has prior experience with web technologies, this book is for you.",

    "description": "Your desktop dictionary may not include it, but 'munging' is a common term in the programmer's world. Many computing tasks require taking data from one computer system, manipulating it in some way, and passing it to another. Munging can mean manipulating raw data to achieve a final form. It can mean parsing or filtering data, or the many steps required for data recognition. Or it can be something as simple as converting hours worked plus pay rates into a salary cheque.    This book shows you how to process data productively with Perl. It discusses general munging techniques and how to think about data munging problems. You will learn how to decouple the various stages of munging programs, how to design data structures, how to emulate the Unix filter model, etc. If you need to work with complex data formats it will teach you how to do that and also how to build your own tools to process these formats. The book includes detailed techniques for processing HTML and XML. And, it shows you how to build your own parsers to process data of arbitrary complexity.    If you are a programmer who munges data, this book will save you time. It will teach you systematic and powerful techniques using Perl. If you are not a Perl programmer, this book may just convince you to add Perl to your repertoire.",

    "description": "With the tremendous penetration of J2EE in the enterprise, passing the Sun Certified Web Component Developer exam has become an important qualification for Java and J2EE developers. To pass the SCWCD exam (Number: 310-081) you need to answer 69 questions in 135 minutes and get 62% of them right. You also need  150 and this (completely updated and newly revised) book.    In its first edition, the SCWCD Exam Study Kit was the most popular book used to pass this most desirable web development certification exam. The new edition will help you learn the concepts    large and small    that you need to know. It covers the newest version of the exam and not a single topic is missed.    The SCWCD exam is for Sun Certified Java Programmers who have a certain amount of experience with Servlets and JSPs, but for those who do not, the book starts with three introductory chapters on these topics. Although the SCWCD Exam Study Kit has one purpose, to help you get certified, you will find yourself returning to it as a reference after passing the exam.",

The second part shows how to put to those blocks together to assemble interesting and useful blog applications.    In keeping with the principle behind Manning   s    In Action    series, this book shows the reader, through numerous examples in Java and C#, how to parse Atom and RSS format newsfeeds, how to generate valid newsfeeds and serve them efficiently, and howto automate blogging via web services based on the new Atom protocol and the older MetaWeblog API. The book also shows how to develop a complete blog client library that readers can use in their own applications. The second half of the book is devoted to a dozen blog apps   small but immediately useful example applications such as a community aggregator, a file distribution newsfeed, a blog cross-poster, an email-to-blog gateway, Ant tasks for blogging software builds, and more.",

But most information today is still locked away in application-specific repositories that lack LDAP access.    LDAP Programming, Management and Integration explains how to link non-LDAP data with LDAP directories. It starts with a concise introduction to the LDAP standard and discusses how to work with it in Java and Perl. It gives you practical code and advice for migrating and integrating data into an LDAP environment. And it explains how to increase your application's security using identity and profile information from LDAP repositories.    Written for programmers and system administrators, this book teaches clearly and honestly the LDAP practiced  in the trenches.  It is concise yet rich in practical examples that make a sometimes complex subject easy to understand.",

Python and Tkinter Programming is the answer. It is designed for readers who are familiar with Python and who need to develop applications with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).    Python and Tkinter Programming presents the elements of typical Python and Tkinter applications in a straight-forward fashion. Sample code illustrates each element. Complete applications that go far beyond the fill-the-form class of graphical user interfaces are presented; here you will find examples of complex controls, drawn interfaces and photorealistic panels. The code can readily be used as templates for new applications. Extensions to Python (such as ODBC) are examined as well. Complete source code for all examples, along with the latest releases of required software, will be available from Manning's web site.    Tkinter is fully documented. To date, this level of documentation has not been available to Tkinter programmers, who have been required to read the code or interpret Tcl/Tk man pages to fully understand component usage.    Python and Tkinter Programming will be useful in both Windows and Unix environments, and the example code is portable between the two environments.",

    "description": "The Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a new technology from Google that automatically translates Java into JavaScript, making Ajax applications easier to code and deploy. GWT in Action is a comprehensive tutorial for Java developers interested in building the next generation of rich, web-based applications. This book was written by Robert Hanson, creator of the popular GWT Widget Library, and Adam Tacy, a major contributor to the GWT Widget Library.    The Web is experiencing a new growth with an emphasis on rich, web-based applications. These applications can be difficult to build because they rely on JavaScript, which lacks the sophisticated object-oriented structures and static typing of Java, they are tricky to debug, and they require you to manage numerous browser inconsistencies.    In May of 2006 Google released the Google Web Toolkit. GWT enables developers to create Ajax applications in Java. With GWT, you can build your applications using a real object-oriented language and take advantage of Java tools like Eclipse that are already available. Instead of trying to bring tool support to Ajax, Google brought Ajax to a place where the tools already existed.    GWT in Action shows you how to take advantage of these exciting new tools. This clearly-written book is packed with hands-on GWT examples. You   ll absorb the GWT philosophy as you build your first working GWT application.    The book begins by exploring the main features of GWT, including    Compiling Java to JavaScript, the magic that really defines GWT  Building client-side components  Convenient JUnit integration and testing  Interacting with JavaScript and existing JavaScript libraries  Internationalization  You   ll also see how GWT compares to other toolkits.    GWT in Action shows you how to set up your development environment, use and create widgets, communicate with the server, and much more. Readers will follow an example running throughout the book and quickly master the basics of GWT: widgets, panels, and event handling. The book covers the full development cycle, from setting up your development environment, to building the application, then deploying it to the web server. The entire core GWT library is discussed, with details and examples on how it can be extended.    You   ll cover:    Testing, debugging, and deploying GWT Applications  Communicating with GWT-RPC  Examining client-side RPC architecture  Alternative RPC tools: HTTPRequest, RequestBuilder, and FormPanel  Achieving interoperability in GWT with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  Making your GWT application flexible and supportable  GWT helps you make the most of Ajax in your web applications and GWT in Action helps you get more out of GWT.",

However, it provides more than just a beginners tutorial. Even once you've become more experienced, it should continue to be quite valuable to you as an indexed cache of information on the bulk of the Python concepts and constructs of which you will find yourself wanting to refresh or augment your knowledge.    It first covers the core features of Python (syntax, control flow, basic data structures, etc.) and provides the knowledge to write basic but useful scripts. Features in Python common to other languages are covered very concisely, while features unique to Python are explained in detail.    It next discusses Python features which would be useful to anyone using Python in larger applications, including facilities for managing large collections of code, object-oriented programming, advanced string handling, etc.    The last section of the book discusses advanced topics: Windows/COM programming with Python, integrating Python and Java (Python is one of the few languages other than Java which can be compiled into Java bytecode), extending the Python language with C, and an introduction to some of the advanced web site building tools that are available for Python.",

    "description": "Many software projects fail unnecessarily because of unclear objectives, redundant and unproductive work, cost overruns, and a host of other avoidable process problems. In response, agile processes and lightweight tooling have begun to replace traditional engineering processes throughout the development lifecycle. An agile approach to application lifecycle management improves product quality, reduces time to market, and makes for happier developers.    Agile ALM is a guide for Java developers who want to integrate flexible agile practices and lightweight tooling along all phases of the software development process. The book introduces a new vision for managing change in requirements and process more efficiently and flexibly. You'll learn powerful practices like task-based Development, where you align activities into tasks resulting in traceable artifacts, Continuous Integration, in which you frequently and systematically integrate, build, and test an application in development and using Scrum as an agile approach to release management. The effect is a more comprehensive and practical approach to build, configuration, deployment, release, test, quality, integration, and requirements management.    This book synthesizes technical and functional elements to provide a comprehensive approach to software development. You'll learn to see the whole scope of the development process as a set of defined tasks, many of which are repeated daily, and then master the tools and practices you need to accomplish each of those tasks efficiently.    Because efficient tool chains can radically improve the speed and fluidity of the development process, this book demonstrates how to integrate state-of-the-art lightweight tools. Many of the tools and examples are Java-based, but the Agile ALM principles apply to all development platforms. As well, the many examples show how you can bridge different languages and systems.",

    "description": "Statistical data is only as valuable as your ability to analyze, interpret, and present it in a meaningful way. Gnuplot is the most widely used program to plot and visualize data for Unix/Linux systems and it is also popular for Windows and the Mac. It's open-source (as in free!), actively maintained, stable, and mature. It can deal with arbitrarily large data sets and is capable of producing high-quality, publication-ready graphics.    So far, the only comprehensive documentation available about gnuplot is the online reference documentation, which makes it both hard to get started and almost impossible to get a complete overview over all of its features. If you've never tried gnuplot   or have found it tough to get your arms around   read on.    Gnuplot in Action is the first comprehensive introduction to gnuplot   from the basics to the power features and beyond. Besides providing a tutorial on gnuplot itself, it demonstrates how to apply and use gnuplot to extract intelligence from data. Particular attention is paid to tricky or poorly-explained areas. You will learn how to apply gnuplot to actual data analysis problems. This book looks at different types of graphs that can be generated with gnuplot and will discuss when and how to use them to extract actual information from data.    One of gnuplot's main advantages is that it requires no programming skills nor knowledge of advanced mathematical or statistical concepts. Gnuplot in Action assumes you have no previous knowledge of either gnuplot or statistics and data analysis. The books starts out with basic gnuplot concepts, then describes in depth how to get a graph ready for final presentation and to make it look \"just right\" by including arrows, labels, and other decorations.    Next the book looks at advanced concepts, such as multi-dimensional graphs and false-color plots   powerful features for special purposes. The author also describes advanced applications of gnuplot, such as how to script gnuplot so that it can run unattended as a batch job, and how to call gnuplot from within a CGI script to generate graphics for dynamic websites on demand.    Gnuplot in Action makes gnuplot easy for anyone who needs to do data analysis, but doesn't have an education in analytical tools and methods. It's perfect for DBAs, programmers, and performance engineers; business analysts and MBAs; and Six-Sigma Black Belts and process engineers.",

It covers all the fundamental elements of Perl (e.g., pattern matching and text processing) and proceeds to advanced concepts, including modular programming, abstract data structures, and object oriented programming.    Elements of Programming with Perl contains numerous examples and diagrams that illustrate concepts, algorithms and techniques. Complete example programs show the new programmer how to tie concepts together to solve real-world problems.    Elements of Programming with Perl is designed for the new programmer who needs to know Perl, and for the regular Perl user who would like to improve his or her programming skills.",

Unlike most other books about SOA that merely describe the standards, this book helps readers learn through action, by walking them through sample code that illustrates how real life problems can be solved using the techniques and best practices described in the standards. It simplifies things: where standards usually discuss many possible variations of each security technique, this book focuses on the 20% of variations that are used 80% of the time. This keeps the material covered useful for all readers except the most advanced.",

    "description": "Laszlo in Action is the first comprehensive guide to the Laszlo system and its language LZX. OpenLaszlo is an increasingly popular open-source platform for the development and delivery of rich internet applications across multiple platforms: Flash, DHTML, and J2ME. The dramatic emergence of Ajax over the past year was a first step in the transition from page-oriented HTML web applications towards more full-featured rich internet applications. OpenLaszlo provides another important step in this continuing evolutionary process through the increased productivity resulting from LZX's declarative approach. It provides developers with the tools to create web-based applications offering the usability and interactivity associated with desktop applications, and the low costs associated with web-based deployment. The cross-platform nature of Laszlo LZX applications allows source code with only minimum modifications to run natively on all popular web browsers, on all desktop operating systems, on the Flash platform, and other platforms in the future.    Written to address the needs of a wide spectrum of developers, ranging from client-side HTML and JavaScript developers all the way to enterprise-class Java or Rails engineers, this book provides a very hands-on approach towards building applications that solve real-world problems across both the Flash and DHTML platforms. Starting with the fundamentals of Laszlo LZX, the authors quickly move towards applying this knowledge to the design and development of a full-scale application called the Laszlo Market. This provides a working context to assist understanding the underlying concepts of Laszlo LZX and, more importantly, how to apply this knowledge in innovative ways. The construction of the Laszlo Market proceeds over the course of the book illustrating topics starting with an initial wireframe and storyboard design to optimization issues dealing with the application's deployment across the Flash and DHTML platforms.",

Groovy in Action is a comprehensive guide to Groovy programming, introducing Java developers to the new dynamic features that Groovy provides. To bring you Groovy in Action, Manning again went to the source by working with a team of expert authors including both members and the manager of the Groovy Project team. The result is the true definitive guide to the new Groovy language.    Groovy in Action introduces Groovy by example, presenting lots of reusable code while explaining the underlying concepts. Java developers new to Groovy find a smooth transition into the dynamic programming world. Groovy experts gain a solid reference that challenges them to explore Groovy deeply and creatively.    Because Groovy is so new, most readers will be learning it from scratch. Groovy in Action quickly moves through the Groovy basics, including:    Simple and collective Groovy data types  Working with closures and Groovy control structures  Dynamic Object Orientation, Groovy style  Readers are presented with rich and detailed examples illustrating Groovy's enhancements to Java, including    How to work with builders and the GDK  Database programming with Groovy  Groovy in Action then demonstrates how to Integrate Groovy with XML, and provides,    Tips and Tricks  Unit testing and build support  Groovy on Windows  An additional bonus is a chapter dedicated to Grails, the Groovy web application framework.",

Only then do you write the code itself and, with the test spurring you on, improve your design. In acceptance test-driven development (ATDD), you use the same technique to implement product features, benefiting from iterative development, rapid feedback cycles, and better-defined requirements. TDD and its supporting tools and techniques lead to better software faster.    Test Driven brings under one cover practical TDD techniques distilled from several years of community experience. With examples in Java and the Java EE environment, it explores both the techniques and the mindset of TDD and ATDD. It uses carefully chosen examples to illustrate TDD tools and design patterns, not in the abstract but concretely in the context of the technologies you face at work. It is accessible to TDD beginners, and it offers effective and less-well-known techniques to older TDD hands.",

As NHibernate is a port of Hibernate from Java to .NET, the book is based on Manning's bestselling Hibernate in Action.    NHibernate in Action begins by describing how to implement persistence in a layered .NET application. The book then quickly springs into action by introducing NHibernate through a classic \"Hello World\" example. It explains how to configure NHibernate to specify the mapping information between business objects and database tables, and then explores the internal architecture of NHibernate. A complete example application is progressively built with Agile methodologies in mind, which shows readers all kinds of entity and relationship mappings and how to perform CRUD operations. The book also covers advanced techniques like caching, concurrency access, and isolation levels. The Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and criteria query APIs are thoroughly detailed with optimization tips.    The last chapters of this book discuss various development scenarios, how to implement the layers of an NHibernate application (covering Windows and Web development), and which tools are available for these tasks. They also provide some solutions for data-binding objects to .NET GUI controls, integrating services, and interacting with components using DataSets. Finally, they explain how to build a complex application involving advanced session management and distributed transactions.",

    "description": "A software system is the realization of a set of concerns. One of the central premises of object-oriented programming is that each concern should be implemented as a separate module. However, there are certain system-wide concerns, such as logging, security, performance, and so forth, that often need to be addressed in many, if not all of the modules. Consequently, the code to handle these system-wide concerns may be mixed in with the core logic of a huge number of modules, resulting in lower productivity, poor quality, and systems that are hard to evolve.    Aspect-oriented programming overcomes these problems by modularizing the system-wide concerns.    AspectJ enables AOP programming in Java by adding a few new language constructs. By using Java as the base language and creating a final system that is compatible with Java byte code specification, AspectJ passes on all the benefits of Java. The use of Java as the base language also makes AspectJ a relatively easy language to learn.    AspectJ in Action is a practical guide to AOP and AspectJ. The reusable code examples that are provided will enable quick implementation of functionality in your system.    The book is divided into three parts. The first part introduces AOP and AspectJ and will be helpful to developers wanting to learn or advance their knowledge of AspectJ. The second and third parts present examples of everyday situations in which you can use simple and easy AspectJ solutions to implement common system requirements such as logging, policy enforcement, resource pooling, business rules, thread-safety, authentication and authorization, as well as transaction management.",

    "description": "Many web development frustrations can be traced back to the underlying stateless HTTP protocol. Tapestry represents state and behavior as standard Java objects, methods and properties. That means state management and multithreading are handled by the framework, leaving you with just your application's business logic. Tapestry does more, you do less.    Tapestry in Action is the definitive guide to the Tapestry approach: creating full-featured web apps by connecting framework components to economical amounts of application code. Many simple examples show you how to tackle common tasks such as form validation, application localization, client-side scripting, and synchronization between browser and app server. Later chapters discuss more advanced topics including creation of new components and integration with J2EE.    If you want to create great web applications using Tapestry and know Java (plus plain-vanilla HTML and a little XML), this book is for you.",

It provides out-of-the-box functionality developers need to build well-designed applications that are modular and reusable. Written by its two primary developers, WebWork in Action is the first book to focus entirely on WebWork. Like a true \"In Action\" book, it is both a tutorial on WebWork and a sourcebook for its use in demanding, real-world applications.    Starting with \"Hello World\" the Webwork way, the book immerses the reader in practical, how-to material. You will soon know how to configure WebWork and gradually and incrementally master the robust and powerful uses of the framework. WebWork in Action uses the same basic, continuing example used in Manning's Hibernate in Action to show how to integrate WebWork with the popular Hibernate persistence framework.",

It addreses O/R mapping issues by making query operations like SQL statements part of the programming language. Adding to its power, LINQ is extensible and can be used to query various data sources. It offers built-in support for querying in-memory collections like arrays or lists, XML, DataSets, and relational databases.    LINQ in Action is a fast-paced, comprehensive tutorial for professional developers who want to use LINQ. This book explores what can be done with LINQ, shows you how it works in an application, and addresses the emerging best practices. It presents the general purpose query facilities offered by LINQ in the upcoming C# 3.0 and VB.NET 9.0 languages. A running example introduces basic LINQ concepts. You   ll then learn to query unstructured data using LINQ to XML and relational data with LINQ to SQL. Finally, you   ll see how to extend LINQ for custom applications.    LINQ in Action will guide you along as you navigate this new world of lambda expressions, query operators, and expression trees. You   ll also explore the new features of C# 3.0, VB.NET 9.0. The book is very practical, anchoring each new idea with running code.    You will discover all the basics needed to get a clear understanding of LINQ. Whether you want to use LINQ to query objects, XML documents, or relational databases, you will find all the information you need to get started.    But LINQ in Action does not stop at the basic code. This book also shows you how LINQ can be used for advanced processing of data. This includes coverage of LINQ   s extensibility, which allows querying more data sources than those supported by default.    All code samples are built on a concrete business case. The running example, LinqBooks, is a personal book cataloging system that shows you how to create LINQ applications with Visual Studio 2008.",

Many Web 2.0 applications use powerful techniques to process information intelligently and offer features based on patterns and relationships in the data that couldn't be discovered manually. Successful examples of these Algorithms of the Intelligent Web include household names like Google Ad Sense, Netflix, and Amazon. These applications use the internet as a platform that not only gathers data at an ever-increasing pace but also systematically transforms the raw data into actionable information.    Algorithms of the Intelligent Web is an example-driven blueprint for creating applications that collect, analyze, and act on the massive quantities of data users leave in their wake as they use the web. You'll learn how to build Amazon- and Netflix-style recommendation engines, and how the same techniques apply to people matches on social-networking sites. See how click-trace analysis can result in smarter ad rotations. With a plethora of examples and extensive detail, this book shows you how to build Web 2.0 applications that are as smart as your users.",

This has proven to be a powerful combination that results in better designed software with fewer defects and faster delivery cycles.    JUnit in Action shows you how to benefit from this strategy using the popular open source testing framework, JUnit. It's a no fluff discussion of unit testing techniques and best practices. It gives examples of tough situations such as how to unit test EJBs, database applications, JSPs and Taglibs. It discusses unit testing of J2EE applications, and shows how to test in automated builds.",

Maximum MIDI gives programmers two ways to add MIDI to their programs. A flexible toolkit of C and C++ routines makes developing Windows 95 MIDI programs a breeze, and rock-solid algorithms and tons of field-tested source code allow advanced users to quickly \"roll their own\"--on any platform. Over a dozen example programs show how it's done.    NEW! The Maximum MIDI Programmer's ToolKit now supports both Windows 95 and Windows NT. Popular demand, insomnia, and caffeine have finally convinced Paul to port the ToolKit to NT. Your copy of Maximum MIDI: Music Applications in C++ entitles you to download the updated 95/NT DLLs (including source code) from the Maximum MIDI website. The new code--and ToolKit support via the book's Author Online forum--is only available to owners of the book.",

    "description": "Whether you're writing a desktop app, spinning up a rich web interface, or pushing code to a mobile phone, graphics programming should be easier, and more fun, than it currently is. New technologies and devices   not to mention higher user expectations   have greatly multiplied the complexity level of interface programming. Enter JavaFX.    JavaFX is a set of Java-based rich user interface technologies that sits atop the existing Java Standard and Micro Editions, making current Java packages readily accessible from the JavaFX environment. At its heart is JavaFX Script, an innovative, compiled, domain specific language. JavaFX Script boasts a declarative syntax where the code structure mirrors the structure of the interface. Related UI pieces are kept in one efficient bundle, not strewn across multiple locations. A simple coding model reduces code complexity while increasing productivity. The JavaFX-specific libraries for presentation and animation take advantage of JavaFX Script's unique language features.    JavaFX in Action is a hands-on tutorial that introduces and explores JavaFX through numerous bite-sized projects. The book provides a solid grounding in the JavaFX syntax and related APIs by showing you how to apply the key features of the JavaFX platform. You'll absorb the fundamentals of the technology while exploring the possibilities JavaFX open up for your designs.    Author Simon Morris helps you transform variables and operators into bouncing raindrops, brilliant colors, and dancing interface components. Below the chrome, you'll master techniques to make your applications more responsive and user friendly. You'll also learn how to interact with your existing Java code so you can give your old apps some new JavaFX sparkle.",

An ongoing focus on the full lifecycle, including administration and deployment, makes this book a rare, practical guide. One of its themes is the theoretical \"three-zeroes\" goal for server development--zero development, zero administration, and zero deployment.    Server-Based Java Programming isn't just about implementation--it's also about architecture, and design. You'll learn how to write the code that sustains a cutting-edge enterprise. You will learn nuts-and-bolts topics like ClassLoaders, threads, CORBA, RMI/IIOP, and JNI, as well as how to make each of these contribute to enterprise-wide goals such as fault-tolerance, easier system administration, five-nine availability, deployment without headaches, and lower development costs.",

A CRM application must know about the order history of a customer, but that history is stored in the sales application. A technology that companies increasingly use to integrate enterprise applications is the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).    Open-Source ESBs in Action describes how to use ESBs in real-world situations. You will learn how the various features of an ESB such as transformation, routing, security, connectivity, and more can be implemented on the example of two open-source ESB implementations: Mule and ServiceMix. The authors first introduce ServiceMix and Mule, and then present general principles and patterns of ESB use, as well as a structured approach to solving common integration problems, through examples using them.    Working in integration projects is exciting, with new technologies and paradigms arriving every day. In this area, open source is playing a more and more dominant role with projects such as Mule and ServiceMix. Open-Source ESBs in Action will help you to learn open-source integration technologies quickly and will provide you with knowledge that you can use to effectively work with Mule and ServiceMix.",

If you want some of that, there's no better way to start your testing habit, nor to continue feeding it, than with JUnit Recipes. In this book you will find one hundred and thirty seven solutions to a range of problems, from simple to complex, selected for you by an experienced developer and master tester. Each recipe follows the same organization giving you the problem and its background before discussing your options in solving it.    JUnit - the unit testing framework for Java - is simple to use, but some code can be tricky to test. When you're facing such code you will be glad to have this book. It is a how-to reference full of practical advice on all issues of testing, from how to name your test case classes to how to test complicated J2EE applications. Its valuable advice includes side matters that can have a big payoff, like how to organize your test data or how to manage expensive test resources.",

The book provides invaluable guidance on whether to use Java 3D, user interface design, geometry creation, scene manipulation and final optimizations. The book does not attempt to exhaustively cover the API or replicate the official documentation but rather serves as a roadmap to alert programmers of design issues and potential pitfalls.    The author distills 12 months of using the Java 3D API for commercial projects, as well as innumerable discussions on the Java 3D email list into a book that all Java 3D developers will appreciate. Experienced Java 3D developers will applaud an authoritative resource containing the state-of-the-art in techniques and workarounds, while novice Java 3D programmers will gain a fast-track into Java 3D development, avoiding the confusion, frustration and time wasted learning Java 3D techniques and terminology.    Java 3D Programming comes complete with a comprehensive set of programming examples to illustrate the techniques, features, workarounds and bug fixes contained in the main text.    Readers of this book would include students and postgraduate researchers developing visualization applications for academia. Moderately experienced in Java, some experience of 3D graphics, little or no experience of Java 3D is needed. R+D s/w engineers at commercial institutions. Experienced Java developers, experienced with OpenGL or VRML, little or no experience with Java 3D.",

By representing these components as tags, code authors can open up their JSP development to the everyday content developer as well as improve their code reuse and separation between presentation and business logic.    The book is fully loaded with many real-world tags including tags to perform iterations, access databases, EJBs, email systems and JavaBeans. To make the tag usage even more real, the book also offers two full-scale case studies in which the reader will see how tags can be used in the context of:    e-Commerce applications  WAP applications that work with current cellular phones  This book covers all aspects of JSP Tag development for Scriptlet-free generation of online content. It focuses on reusable component-centric design via JavaBeans and custom tags to separate presentation from implementation.",

By presenting the emerging best practices and designs from the Scala community, it guides you though dozens of powerful techniques example by example. There's no heavy-handed theory here-just lots of crisp, practical guides for coding in Scala.    For example:        * Discover the \"sweet spots\" where object-oriented and functional programming intersect.      * Master advanced OO features of Scala, including type member inheritance, multiple inheritance and composition.      * Employ functional programming concepts like tail recursion, immutability, and monadic operations.      * Learn good Scala style to keep your code concise, expressive and readable.    As you dig into the book, you'll start to appreciate what makes Scala really shine. For instance, the Scala type system is very, very powerful; this book provides use case approaches to manipulating the type system and covers how to use type constraints to enforce design constraints. Java developers love Scala's deep integration with Java and the JVM Ecosystem, and this book shows you how to leverage it effectively and work around the rough spots.",

    "description": "With Java Management Extensions (JMX), you can configure, manage and monitor your Java applications at run-time, as well as break your applications into components that can be swapped out. JMX provides a window into an application's state and its behavior, and a protocol-independent way of altering both state and behavior. It lets you expose portions of your application in just a few lines of code.    Written for both new and experienced developers, this book explains the JMX specification and discusses its use through clean, well-discussed examples. It covers the JMX architecture and how to create all types of MBeans. It includes important advanced topics such as extending the JMX classes, combining with other Java technologies, the MBean relation service, dynamic MBean loading, and creating your own protocol adapters.",

Reusing design patterns is not enough for success: patterns are like partial maps of dangerous terrain. They help, but don't prevent you from getting lost. Bitter Java teaches you how to recognize when you are lost, and how to get back on the right path. It illustrates common pitfalls of Java programming through code examples; it then refactors the code and explains why the new solutions are safe.    This book is a systematic account of common server-side Java programming mistakes, their causes and solutions. It covers antipatterns for base Java and J2EE concepts such as Servlets, JSPs, EJBs, enterprise connection models, and scalability. If you are an intermediate Java programmer, analyst or architect eager to avoid the bitter experiences of others, this book is for you.",

A new species is evolving to take their place, one which is lean, fast, portable, and easy to maintain: Java servlets.    Servlets are not merely an alternative to CGI, for they can do much more. Servlets have opened the door to a world of client/server applications that would have been too difficult or too time-consuming to consider before.    Java Servlets: By Example takes the reader into the world of servlets, moving example by example from the simple to the complex. An early chapter explains the simple HTML form processing through servlets. A later chapter shows how to connect a Java applet to a servlet, which is itself connected to a database.    Java Servlets: By Example is full of real-world, ready-to-run example code. Each chapter deals with a new problem and takes the reader through a series of servlet-based solutions. However, the book is detailed enough that it may also serve as a reference for the developer.",
